I am a postdoc in Chemical Engineering at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/academics/engineering/). My research includes atomistic simulations accelerated using machine learning methods to study liquid phase catalysis for CO desorption.<br><br>
I completed my PhD in Chemical Engineering from [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://chbe.gatech.edu/). My PhD research focused on the modeling of [Metal-Organic Frameworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal%E2%80%93organic_framework/) (MOFs) for adsorption and kinetic separation of various gases. MOFs are an extremely diverse set of intrinsically flexible nanoporous materials that allow for a rich set of computational studies. I performed high-throughput screening of MOFs for contaminant removal, and studied the effect of the flexibility in MOFs on their adsorption and diffusion properties. Most of this work is directed towards finding new materials for real world engineering applications and accurately predicting their properties using computational simulations.
